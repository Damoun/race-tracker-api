# Allow optimization of some AST trees. This will activate a peephole AST
# optimizer, which will apply various small optimizations. For instance, it can
# be used to obtain the result of joining multiple strings with the addition
# operator. Joining a lot of strings can lead to a maximum recursion error in
# Pylint and this flag can prevent that. It has one side effect, the resulting
# AST will be different than the one from reality.

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
# file where it should appear only once).You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then reenable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
# no Warning level messages displayed, use"--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W"
